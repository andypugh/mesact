# mesact

The LinuxCNC community showed me they won't use my tools because they are not part of LinuxCNC. Not wishing to step on Chris M. the author of pncconf toes I decided early on to not add my tools to LinuxCNC. So if anyone happens upon this repository I felt that just being missing was not nice. At least an explanation of what happened is due.

So due to no one using my tool to create a configuration or trouble shoot their PC or NIC I decided to delete the repository and all the other repositories that had Mesa configuration tools.

It was a very interesting challenge for sure, however if no one uses the tool all the thousands of hours of work were a waste of my time from the standpoint of trying to help others configure their Mesa card. It was however a good learning experiance for Python.
